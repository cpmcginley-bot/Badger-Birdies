          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Badger Birdies was created by two friends and golf enthusiasts —
            Jason Reetz and Collin McGinley, students at the University of
            Wisconsin–Madison who share a passion for golf, competition, and
            community.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we first came to campus, we quickly realized that finding golf
            partners or even knowing where to play wasn’t as simple as we
            thought. Madison and Dane County are home to some of the most
            beautiful and well-maintained public courses in the Midwest — from
            Odana Hills and Yahara Hills to Glenway Golf Park — yet there wasn’t
            a single platform connecting UW students to these amazing local
            opportunities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most students don’t have the luxury of a car, a country club
            membership, or the time to coordinate tee times. We saw a clear need
            for something simple — a way for golfers to connect, network, and
            enjoy the game together without the barriers of transportation,
            cost, or scheduling headaches.
          </p>

          <p>So we built Badger Birdies.</p>

          <hr />

          <h3>What We Believe</h3>
          <p>
            Badger Birdies was founded on the idea that golf at UW–Madison
            should be as accessible and social as any campus sport or club. We
            believe that golf isn’t just about birdies and bogeys — it’s about
            the friendships and experiences made along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is to create a community where students can easily find
            courses, meet other golfers, share their scores, and compete in a
            friendly, welcoming environment. Whether you’re an experienced
            player looking for competition or a beginner hoping to learn, Badger
            Birdies gives you a place to belong.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>
            We envision a platform that brings together the talent, passion, and
            scenic beauty that define golf in Dane County. With courses set
            among rolling hills, lakes, and parkland fairways, Madison offers
            some of the most rewarding golf in the country — yet too few
            students get to experience it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Badger Birdies helps solve that. We provide a central hub where
            students can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Discover affordable, nearby golf courses.</li>
            <li>
              Connect with other UW–Madison golfers by handicap or skill level.
            </li>
            <li>
              Track scores and leaderboards to bring friendly competition to
              campus.
            </li>
            <li>Stay updated on local events, deals, and student scrambles.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            By making golf more accessible, we hope to grow a vibrant golf
            culture at UW–Madison — one built on inclusion, sportsmanship, and
            school pride.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Golf has a unique way of bringing people together. It teaches
            patience, respect, and perseverance — qualities that carry far
            beyond the course. For students balancing classes, jobs, and life, a
            day on the course can be both a challenge and a reset.
          </p>

          <p>
            Badger Birdies exists to make those experiences possible. To give
            UW–Madison students a break from the rush, to build friendships
            through competition, and to celebrate the sport we all love.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h3>The Future of Badger Birdies</h3>
          <p>
            What started as a small idea between two golfers has grown into
            something bigger than we imagined. As we continue developing the
            site, our goal is to expand features like matchmaking, score
            tracking, and course reviews, while keeping the platform 100%
            student-focused and easy to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            We’re proud to represent the Badger spirit — resilient, passionate,
            and community-driven — both on and off the course.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because at the end of the day, golf at UW–Madison isn’t just about
            playing well. It’s about playing together.
