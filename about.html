            A student-led project to make golf more accessible and social at
            UW–Madison.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Badger Birdies was created by two friends and golf enthusiasts —
            Jason Reetz and Collin McGinley, students at the University of
            Wisconsin–Madison who share a passion for golf, competition, and
            community.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we first came to campus, we quickly realized that finding golf
            partners or even knowing where to play wasn’t as simple as we
            thought. Madison and Dane County have many beautiful public courses,
            yet there was no single place for students to connect around golf.
          </p>

          <p>So we built Badger Birdies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What We Believe</h2>
          <p>
            We believe golf at UW–Madison should be accessible, social, and
            welcoming. Badger Birdies helps students discover courses, meet
            other golfers, and enjoy friendly competition.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Goals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Help students find nearby, affordable golf courses.</li>
            <li>Connect golfers by ability and interest.</li>
            <li>Provide a simple place to share scores and events.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Golf builds patience, respect, and community. For busy students, it
            offers a chance to reset and make lasting friendships.
